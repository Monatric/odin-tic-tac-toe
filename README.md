**Tic Tac Toe**
The first object oriented project. It is a classic game consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, much like a # symbol.

The game is played by two players. One plays the letter X, the other plays O. The players take one turn each, and they must select a part of the grid. The round continues until either there are no spaces left or a winner has been established.

To win this game, a player must connect the letter assigned to them. It can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, just like so:

 X | O |
___|___|___
 O | X |
___|___|___
 O |   | X
   |   |
